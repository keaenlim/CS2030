# 📘 CS2030: Programming Methodology II

## 🎯 Course Overview
CS2030 is an advanced Java programming course that introduces key concepts in **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **functional programming (FP)**, and **concurrent programming**. The course is known for its **challenging** yet **rewarding** nature, requiring students to think critically and write clean, efficient code.

This repository serves as a **guide/walkthrough** for CS2030, providing structured explanations, best practices, and solutions to help navigate the course successfully.

The course layout is as such - 1 Lecture (2hr), 1 Recitation (1hr), 1 Lab (2hr) per week 

## 📌 Topics Covered
### 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes & Interfaces
- Immutable Objects & Design Patterns
- "Tell don't ask" principle

### ⚡ Functional Programming (FP)
- Lambda Expressions & Streams
- Higher-Order Functions
- Lazy Evaluation & Memoization
- Persistent Data Structures

### 🔄 Concurrent Programming
- Multi-threading & Synchronization
- Asynchronous Computation
- Futures & Promises

### 🏛️ Software Engineering Principles
- Immutability & Side Effects
- Testing & Debugging
- Code Style & Best Practices

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Repository
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (**JDK 21+** recommended)
- JShell for interactive exploration
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

## 💡 Tips for Success
- **Master Immutability**: Many questions require immutable data structures.
- **Understand Streams & Lambdas**: They make functional programming easier.
- **Use JShell**: Test your functions interactively.
- **Read Javadoc & Documentation**: The API is your best friend.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
This repository aims to:
- Provide **detailed explanations** for each lab, assignment, and project.
- Offer **step-by-step walkthroughs** of tough concepts.
- Share **useful debugging tips** and **best coding practices**.
